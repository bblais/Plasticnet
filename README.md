## Introduction

This package, which is really two sub-packages, plasticnet and splikes, is an attempt to make a simulation package that will allow for the easy construction of simple neural networks - both spiking and rate-based.  The focus is on a package that will run as quickly as possible, but be general enough to explore research questions.  

This is still a work in progress, and is mostly just useful to myself.
